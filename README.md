# Advanced-Computing

Performed complexity analysis using average time for various sorting algorithms, hashtables and search trees. The comparision is as:

Sorting Algorithms: Mergesort, Quicksort, Heapsort and Dual-pivot Quicksort
Hash Tables: Cuckoo, QuadraticProbing and SeparateChaining  
Search Trees: BinarySearchTree, AVLTree, RedBlackBST, SplayTree

Technology Used: Java, Eclipse IDE

Read Sorting and Edit distance_Report.pdf and HashTables and SearchTrees_Report.pdf for results and conclusion.
